This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Summary
This is a simple weather app where you can get realtime weather data by choice of city. <br>
Add as many cities as you want to the sidebar and view detailed information by clicking on the card components.

## Objectives
I built this weather app to demonstrate my knowledge in React/NextJS and to showcase that I know how to fetch data from an API.


## Tools
For the project, I worked with the following tools:
React, NextJS, Tailwind, OpenWeather API

## Styling
I got the design inspiration from my friend Samuel Kraft who has built this awesome <a href="https://routes.samuelkraft.com/">running app</a>.<br>
When it comes to making the site responsive for mobile I found it a little bit difficult since I'm only working with a Sidebar and Center component.<br><br>
I could solve this by letting the end user toggling back and forth between the Sidebar - Center component on mobile devices. But instead I chooced to not put to much effort into the design, rather showcase that I understand how to fetch key data.


## Installation

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
