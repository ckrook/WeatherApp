# Weather App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Summary
This is a simple weather app where you can get realtime weather data by choice of city. <br>
Add as many cities as you want to the sidebar and view detailed information by clicking on the card components.

## Objectives
I built this weather app to demonstrate my knowledge in React/NextJS and to showcase my knowledge in fetching data from an API. <br>


## Tools
For this project, I worked with the following tools:<br>
<ul>
  <li>React</li>
    <li>NextJs</li>
    <li>Tailwind</li>
    <li>OpenWeather API</li>
  </ul>


## Styling
I got the design inspiration from my friend Samuel Kraft who has built this awesome <a href="https://routes.samuelkraft.com/">running app</a>.<br>
When it comes to making the site responsive for mobile I found it a little bit difficult since I'm only working with a Sidebar and Center component.<br><br>
I could solve this by letting the end user toggling back and forth between the Sidebar - Center component on mobile devices.<br> 
But instead I chose to not put to much effort into the design, rather showcase that I understand how to fetch key data.


## Conclusion
For my next project I would like to try axios and fetch data within the getInitialProps since this is best practice.<br>

## Installation

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
